    Split off the container type (pkg, jar, bottle, etc.) from 
    ProductTable[Quantity Per Unit] into its own column. However, a few entries 
    that end in a simple unit of measurement like "g" and "ml" will end up in the 
    new last column. Instead, for values ending in " g" or " ml" (and possibly others), don't split.
